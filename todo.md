# AgentForge Todo

## Maintenance
- [ ] Monitor `web_interface.log` for stability.
- [ ] Ensure `restart_safe.sh` handles process cleanup reliably on all platforms.

## Future Features
- [ ] Add `/api/health` endpoint for more granular service checks.
- [ ] Implement a dashboard UI in `web_interface/static/index.html` to visualize agent activity (currently static).
- [ ] Sync `status.md` automatically with running services?
